#Introduction

This repository is hosting the R code for the project of the DataScience track's "Getting and Cleaning Data" course.

The purpose of this project is to collect and clean a data set. Tidy data have been prepared for later analysis.

#Data Set

The data set "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" has been taken from UCI.

#Execution and files

The Data Set has been stored in UCI HAR Dataset/ directory.

The CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and the work that has been performed to clean up the data.

The run_analysis.R is the script that has been used for this work. It can be loaded in R/Rstudio and executed.

The result of the script execution is that a tidy.csv file is being created.
